## Terms & Concepts to Understand What Node.js Is

### ECMAScript Summary

- ECMA-262 is the language specification
- ECMAScript is the language that implements ECMA-262
- JavaScript is basically ECMAScript at its core but builds on top of that

### Chrome's V8 Engine Summary

- A JavaScript engine is a program that executes JavaScript code
- In 2008, Google created its own JavaScript engine called V8
- V8 is written in C++ and can be used independently or can be embedded into other C++ programs
- That allows you to write your own C++ programs which can do everything that V8 can do and more
- Your C++ program can run ECMAScript and additional features that you choose to incorporate
- For example, features that are available in C++ but not available with JavaScript

### Chrome Browser JavaScript Engine

### Node.js Summary

- Node.js is an open source, cross platform JavaScript runtime environment
- It is not a language, it is not a framework
- Capable of executing JavaScript code outside a browser
- It can execute not only the standard ECMAScript language but also new features that are made available through C++ bindings using the V8 engine
- It consists of C++ files which form the core features and JavaScript files which expose common utilities and some of the C++ features for easier consumption

### Executing JavaScript with Node

1. **Node REPL**
   - Read
   - Evaluate
   - Print
   - Loop

2. **Executing code in a JavaScript file in the command line**

### Browser vs Node.js

- In the browser, most of the time what you are doing is interacting with the DOM, or other web platform APIs like cookies. You don't have the `document`, `window` and all the other objects that are provided by the browser
- In the browser, we don't have all the nice APIs that Node.js provides through its modules. For example the file-system access functionality
- With Node.js, you control the environment
- With a browser, you are at the mercy of what the users choose
